    <h1>My name is Evan</h1>
    <p>I go to the high school Wake Early College of Information and Biotechnologies. I also take Wake Tech classes. I am currently taking NOS 110 and CTI 110 where we learn various things about computers and computer programming.</p>
    <p>I enjoy programming and have learned JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Python. I am currently learning TypeScript and will probably learn either React JS or C++ after.</p>
    <p>I like coding because it forces me to problem solve. When there is a bug or just a hard task, I need to break the problem down, solve each step, and recombine the steps to create a solution. I enjoy going through this process, especially during the moments of epiphany.</p>
